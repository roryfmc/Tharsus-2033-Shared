# Tharus + Newcastle University 2033 Team 45 Project #
## Introduction ##
Webscraping project, which targets the website www.findchips.com. Created as part of a University project that included working for Tharus. Created to search for hundreds of parts along with the quantity for each part and return the manufacturer's to those parts in stock. Allows user to then export the results to excel. 

## Features ##
* User register and login portal overseen by designated administrator
* Streamlined search function that intergrates directly with webscraping algorithm
* Navigation central user interface
* Export cleaned results to excel

## Installation ## 
git clone https://github.com/roryfmc/Tharsus-2033-Shared

yarn install 

## Potential Issues ##
This main branch uses the uni database. Before submitting I have had issues with the ssh tunnel (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't). If you need to run the program and the ssh tunnel has decided to not work once again, please use our webpage-design branch, which still uses the local database.
The ssh tunnel uses the environment variables CSC_USER and CSC_PASS. Please set them up so that you can use the ssh tunnel when running the program.
